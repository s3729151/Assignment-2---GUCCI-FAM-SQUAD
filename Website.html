My name is Kristian Ortigas, I'm a 17 year              old Filipino boy born and raised in Australia. Since <br>              I was born, my parents have been speaking Tagalog to me, which is              one of the Philippines main Ianguage, so I've known <br>              how to speak Tagalog fluently ever since I could talk, while              English came naturally to me of course. I started off my <br>              education at kindergarten of course, then for primary school i              attended Resurrection primary school from year prep all the<br>              way up to year 6. For my high school years I attended Copperfield              college Sydenham for years 7 to 10 and then the<br>              Delahey campus for years 11 and 12. Currently I am studying at              RMIT grinding for my bachelors degree in Information <br>              Technology. So far I have managed to keep up with everything but              I'm slowly starting to fall behind. The things I'm most <br>              passionate about are traveling, gaming, music, family and              Basketball. I love to travel as I love experiencing different              cultures, <br>              the photo displayed on the right was actually taken in Iceland,              It's a photo of me and a Geyser. Basketball has always been <br>              my favourite sport and I have been playing for a club for 10              years.&nbsp; <br>            </span> </header>        </section>        <br>        <section id="background">          <header style="margin-top:0;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><u><span                style="font-family: Avenir;"><font                  size="6"><br>                  <a name="Interest"> <br>                    <br>                    INTEREST IN I.T.</a></font></span></u><br>          </header>          <section style="margin-top:0;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><br>            <span style="font-family: Avenir;">My interest in IT has always been              gaming, I've always wanted to create video games since I was a              child. My interest in video <br>              games started when my auntie gifted me a PlayStation 2 for my              birthday, I spent most of my time playing Need for Speed <br>              Underground 2, Jak 3 and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. As I got              older I started to play more games on my PlayStation 3 <br>              and my passion for wanting to create games just kept growing. <br>              <br>              In year 11 and 12 I chose the computing and information technology              subjects in school as all the other subjects bore me, I know that              technology is the future of everything and that it would be easier              to find a job in the industry as nearly every company or              organisation needs some kind IT related jobs to keep their company              running. I chose to study at RMIT as it was the only university              that gave me an offer and I know that it's one of the best in              Victoria for Information Technology. I expect to learn many things              in this course such as programming, networking, artificial              intelligence and turning my ideas into reality.<br>              <br>            </span></section>          <section style="margin-top:0;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"> <u><span                style="font-family: Avenir;"><font                  size="6"><br>                  <a name="Ideal"><br>                    <br>                    IDEAL JOB</a></font></span></u><font size="6"><br>              <br>              <img src="Job.jpg" alt="Ad" title="Ad" longdesc="Job.png" style="width: 431px; height: 532px;margin-right: px; margin-left: -1px;"                align="right">            </font><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Avenir;">My ideal                job would be to make my ideas come to life, so in the future i                would like to create apps and games<br>                on mobile devices to see whether my ideas can make my life or                other peoples lives easier. I find that I'm a <br>                creative person and like to create things so I think taking up a                job in the developing field would really interest <br>                me. To me, being a web and mobile app developer means to imagine                what an app or website would look like<br>                and what it would do, then to create it, test it and maintain                it. <br>                <br>                As it is outlined in the advertisement, to be accepted into this                position you would need to work up to and it has <br>                to be something you really want to already have the                qualifications for it. Some of these qualifications include<br>                a minimum of 5 years experience in the web and mobile                development field, knowledge on a number of <br>                programming languages, experience in my SQL and AWS and a great                understanding of database administration.<br>                There are also personal characteristics required for this role                such as having exceptional written and verbal <br>                communication skills, time management skills and discipline, to                work exceptional in a team, to be self motivated <br>                and to be creative and suggest ideas.<br>                <br>                As of right now, I can't say that I have many qualifications but                I am a university student learning to program <br>                with JavaScript and have a bit of knowledge on it from also                doing some work on it in year 11 and 12. I am also <br>                familiar with creating HTML websites and I've also created a                mobile game in high school. As for my personal<br>                characteristics, I would say that I have the written and verbal                communication skills to keep up with everything <br>                and also work well in a group. I would only have to work a bit                more on my time management as right now I<br>                always leave everything to the last minute.<br>                <br>                To obtain the qualifications of this role, I would stay in my                current Information Technology course as I feel that <br>                most qualifications required for this role would be somewhat                taught in this course, and I could always choose <br>                different subjects within this course to assure that I am                learning about this role. After university I would find a <br>                company or organisation to work at with my skills gathered from                my course and gain the experience I need to <br>                then get to the final stage and work for this desired company on                the advertisement.<br>                <br>                <br>              </span></font><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span></font>            <font size="3"> </font>            <p></p>            <font size="5.5"> </font></section>          <font size="6">            <section style="margin-top:0;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><br>              <u><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><br>                  <a name="Profile"> PERSONAL PROFILE</a></span></u><br>              <p><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Avenir;">Results of my                    Myers-Briggs test:</span></font></p>              <center><img src="ENFP.jpg" alt="Enpf" title="Enpf" longdesc="ENFP.png"                  style="width: 599px; height: 111px;"></center>              <font size="6">                <center><img src="Myers-Briggs.jpg" alt="Myers" title="Myers" longdesc="Myers-Briggs.png"                    style="width: 700px; height: 581px;"><br>                </center>                <font size="3"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><br>                    <br>                    <br>                    <br>                    My result from the learning style test:</span></font><br>                <br>                <center><img src="Learning.jpg" alt="Learning" title="Learning"                    longdesc="Learning.png"                    style="width: 616px; height: 220px;"></center>                <br>                <font size="3"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><br>                    <br>                    My creativity test result:</span></font><br>                <br>                <center><img src="Creativity.jpg" alt="Creativty" title="Creativity"                    longdesc="Creativity.png"                    style="width: 846px; height: 189px;"></center>                <br>                <font size="3"><span style="font-family: Avenir;">Conclusion:<br>                    The Myer-Briggs test revealed to me mostly things I already                    knew about myself such as being confident, outgoing,                    assertive, intuitive and that I always follow my feelings                    more. I have always found myself to be confident with                    everything I do and always eager to try new things. I never                    care about what others think of me and that's the main                    reason why I'm confident. As for the learning style test, I                    also already knew that I was a tactile learner and also a                    bit of a visual learner. When processing new information I                    like to be hands on with what I'm learning about and                    figuring it out on my own rather than listening to someone                    explain things as i get quite bored. Visual learning is also                    my thing as I also like to learn from pictures or videos.                    Finally, the creativity test revealed to me that I was 82%                    creative which I also wasn't surprised by as in my spare                    time I do many creative things such as design wallpapers for                    my phone and laptop. I found out that I was creative when my                    poster projects from primary school always stood out from                    all the other students posters.<br>                    <br>                    As shown on my Myers-Briggs test results, extraverted                    assertive individual which makes it easier for me to get                    along with others in groups and for me to make sure that the                    group is always on track, communicating with each other and                    and most of all, having a good time. With me being a tactile                    and visual learner it's easy for me to learn from other                    group members by watching them complete a task and then                    having a go on that task myself and letting myself figure                    things out with the group members. When forming a team, I                    don't really have a preference on who I'm working with as                    long as they play their role. With me being extraverted and                    assertive I find that it's quite easy for me to get along                    with everyone. As for the learning style, it's great to have                    different team members with different learning styles as it                    could translate to getting the end task done more quickly as                    different team members can show and explain to other team                    members what to do and how to do it. I think it's great to                    have a group with very creative group members and for most                    projects only one or two creative group members are required                    for the project to be creative as the creative one in the                    group could explain to the other members in the group how                    they could make the project creative and I'm sure the other                    members would agree. With me being creative I feel that                    although it's great to have other creative minds in a group,                    only one or two are required.<br>                  </span></font><br>                <br>              </font><font size="6">                <p><u><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><a name="Ideas">PROJECT                        IDEA</a></span></u></p>              </font><font size="6">                <p><u><span style="font-family: Avenir;"></span></u></p>              </font>              <center><font size="6"></font><i><b style="font-family: Impact;"><font                      size="8"><br>                      FILL ME IN</font></b></i></center>              <font size="3"> </font></section>          </font></section>        <font size="5.5"><font size="5.5">            <section style="margin-top:0;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><font                size="3">                <p><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><br>                  </span></p>                <p><br>                  <!--StartFragment--> </p>              </font><font size="3">                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU">Growing
                      up, during my free time I would always walk down to my                      local basketball court and play basketball there. Most of                      the time I would be there playing alone but sometimes some                      stranger would come along and join in and it was always a                      great time and experience to play against different                      people. My idea to resolve the problem of people around                      the world having to play sports alone, is to create an app                      that displays the closest parks or sporting centres near                      you and it would also act as a bit of a social network                      that would display if there are any people playing around                      you right now or what time they’ll be coming to play.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>                <span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span>                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>                <span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span>                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU">While

Sports are                      always more fun when playing with other people or against                      each other, shooting around by yourself will never be more                      exciting and better than shooting around with others or                      even playing a classic 5v5. This idea also interests me as                      I was having a talk about it with my basketball team and                      they all said it would be a “game changer.” <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>                <span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span>                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>                <span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span>                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU">The
                      first time the user downloads the app and enters, the app                      will prompt them to create a profile where they can choose                      their chosen sport, add their username and password, add a                      biography, add the courts near them or the courts they                      frequently visit and also optionally add a schedule on                      when they’re usually free to play. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Once
                      all of that is out of the way, there will also be an                      option if the user would like to connect their account to                      Facebook for an easier way to find friends that are                      already using the app. Once the whole registration part is                      finished the user will be free to use the app and access                      all of its features. When opening the app, the app will                      display a large map highlighting all of the basketball                      courts near the user and the highlight will be a different                      colour for different meanings, for example, a red                      highlight if there are more than 10 people at the court, a                      green highlight if there are 5 or more people on the                      court, a yellow highlight if there are 2 or more people on                      the court, a white highlight if there’s no one at the                      court and a blue highlight if there aren’t any people at                      the court for now but people are coming. When viewing the                      map, the user will also see kind of like a snapchat style                      location feature where they get to see where their friends                      are on the map. When a user selects a court, the                      information of the exact people that are there will be                      displayed, an option to invite friends to this court, the                      information about the court, (whether the court is a half                      or full court, what type of ring it is, if its indoor or                      outdoor, if there’s shade if it’s outdoor and if there’s                      any taps nearby. The user could also announce that they                      are at a court or they will be at a court to others that                      have that court saved as their local court. The user would                      also share their info on which court they will be at or                      which court they’re at by selecting the court, but this                      could also be done automatically, when the user walks onto                      a court the app could just gather that the users there                      using location services and just update in the app that                      the user is currently there. For now, that is the full app                      but some fun implementations could be added such as                      competitions at courts with a set date and time, a leader                      board that displays who’s spent the most time at a                      specific court which would label them the “king of the                      court” and also a rating and review system of different                      courts.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>                <span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span>                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>                <span style="font-family: Avenir;"> </span>                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-AU">To
                      create the app, the program xcode would be used to code                      the app, it is free in the apple app store so it is quite                      accessible and easy to install. To download xcode I would                      need a laptop, preferably an apple mac. I would also need                      to have a mobile phone to test what the app would look                      like in person from time to time.

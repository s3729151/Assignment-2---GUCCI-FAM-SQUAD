	<p style="width: 1000px; margin-left: 350px;">
		Hi! Welcome to my profile.
			</p>
	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		My name is Daryl Borcena, I’m 19 years old and I’m currently studying full-time in RMIT University. 
		I’m Filipino, born in the Philippines and shortly left for Australia after 9 years – so most of my childhood was spent in the Philippines. 
		I’m still able to speak Tagalog (which is my mother language) – however it’s very far from fluent. 
		I can understand it perfectly fine, I just can’t make any words out my mouth when it comes to that language. 
		I’m very fluent in English and I’m slowly trying to learn Japanese for future business/personal purposes.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		I’m a fairly extroverted person, so don’t be afraid to talk to me! I always appreciate people’s presence, and I love going out to explore new places 
		and experience new things. A little fun fact about me is that I love music - from simply listening to it, to making it myself with Ableton Live (a music program). 
		I play a few instruments; however, I mainly play the guitar. I do a lot of things in my pastime. I play video games; instruments, watch videos/shows and scroll through my 
		Facebook newsfeed for memes. I happen to run a small Facebook page (around 1.3k likes) based on posting funny things about my favorite pet, DOGS!

			Interest in IT 
				</h2>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		I’m a very tech-savvy person, so naturally IT became an interest to me however, I didn’t start taking it seriously just because I liked using technology. 
		I became interested in IT because of the business and career potential it carries in the future. I learned about IT in year 9 when I was assigned to an IT class. Beforehand, 
		I was just using my PC to play video games and such.  After I got introduced into the IT world, I was hooked. I watched a plethora of TED talks videos about the future of 
		Information Technology, the internet of things, data etc. and that was when I knew what I wanted to do as my career.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		There are two reasons as to why I chose RMIT. When it comes to Information Technology, RMIT is the best in the field. 
		The technology, resources and content provided can’t be compared to other universities teaching in the same field – it also has a name for itself in the 
		industry as it’s a well-known university especially in IT. The second reason why I chose RMIT is so I could explore and experience more of the city. 
		I live quite far away so I never really got to explore the city as much as I would have liked, but now that’s changed.
			</p>	

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		After this course, I expect to have grasped the fundamentals of IT and have 
		enough work experience so it can be used to contribute in the real world of work. Specifically, during my studies, I hope to learn the technical and theoretical aspects of starting 
		a business or anything business related within the IT industry. Whether it be starting my own app or my own program company.
		Since starting anything business related is a long process, I’d like to learn more about programming in order to have a good paying job after university, slowly building up enough 
		money to start a business or a software.

			Ideal Job 
				</h2>

	<img src="MyIdealJob.png" alt="job" style="width: 550px; height: 1300px; margin-left: 650px;">

		<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/35817409?type=standard&userqueryid=7d74488cab00c1136f5c40f54f817995-5413691">
			Manager Information Systems & Technology</a>
				</h4>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		A manager for Information Systems & Technology (IST) requires an individual that can manage projects, teams and policies all the while leading the design, developing and implementing 
		ICT architectures in order to stay consistent with the IST strategy – either designed by you or given to you. Essentially, the IST manager has influence on everything done in the technical 
		field – which is reported on the higher ups of the company.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		The main reason why this position appeals to me is because of its management, business and team aspects. Not only will this give me experience, skills and knowledge on running my own business, 
		this will also provide an opportunity to create bonds with higher ups or professionals that can help me at my own business. It allows me to expand my connections with professionals and such.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		To get into this job, the individual needs to show and demonstrate the ability to communicate and work well in a team environment – this is done by either participating/leading a project or 
		volunteer work/experience with working in non-profit organizations. IT infrastructure planning and development, policies and standards in an enterprise is also a required experience for this job. 
		The ability to oversee, organize, plan and implement ideas in order to avoid problems or fix them as fast as possible. Back again with communication, it’s very important to be able to lead and 
		motivate; co-workers, staff and contractors. High problem-solving skills are also needed since unexpected things can happen in the workplace, especially in this scale of work.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		Currently, I majorly lack the requirements for this job. I have no experience in the IT industry let alone anything heavily IT related in the workplace – but that’s why I’m here! The only skills 
		I have that could be fulfilled in the requirements is my communication skills – however I still have much to learn when it comes to negotiating or communicating with higher ups in a professional manner.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		In order to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience for this position, I need to finish my bachelors.  During my education though, I need to look for volunteer work – locally or out in the 
		city held by an organization. Anything that contributes to increasing my leadership, teamworking skills & problem-solving skills.
			</p>

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		Since I need experience in management (specifically IST management), I’ll be looking for jobs in the field for smaller companies in order to get the experience required. I’ll also look into starting 
		projects for the experience not only for this job, but for my future business. Since it helps with my management skills and demonstrates my ability to control/lead a group of individuals. Working as 
		a lecturer can also help me with the requirements since it shows that I’m able to present information/data to various people – which in turn increases my communication skills in small/large groups. 
		This allows me to demonstrate that I have experience in dealing with a broad range of individuals and groups.

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		The test resulted in me being a campaigner – which in my opinion is extremely accurate, for the most part. It doesn’t really mean much to me since I haven’t really learned anything new – 
		I’m quite impressed at how accurate it is though.
		Since I’ve read the specifications on how I act in a working environment, I feel as if it influences me to work more in a communicative and understanding manner. It also shows me that 
		I’m more than likely to think things ahead of time, but at the same time be able to think of a quick plan to fix an unexpected problem.
		When forming a team, I’d love to have a team full of people that are willing to communicate. I’d like to be the leader/guider of the group just so I could encourage them to explore and list ideas.

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		The test resulted on me being an Auditory/Visual learner. Thanks to these results, I can have more options on how to learn or work at a much more efficient and effective way.
		They made me realize what would work for me in a team working situation, or how I should work. So, I’ll be trying some of these options that the results have provided – such as getting 
		my teammates to speak to me when talking about ideas instead of reading it through a screen etc.
		I have to try and get my team to communicate with me vocally – as much as possible, which means that we have to have meetings and such. I’ll also need to draw or have an overview of our 
		plan so it’ll be easier for me and other visual learners in the team.

	<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
		The test resulted in me having a score of 77.72 which is 14~ more points than average. This means that I’m a bit more creative than most – which is good in terms of 
		creating new ideas and forming solutions to problems.
		I’ll definitely be thinking out of the box in a team environment. I’ll be the person that suggests new ideas and build on already existing ideas within the team.
		When forming a team, I would be most comfortable working with people who are open minded to new or unconventional ideas and assist me in sharpening it,

			 Project Idea
				</h2>

<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
Split is a mobile application for the iOS (which can be implemented into the Android too) which allows its users to transfer money without the hassle of entering details such as their BSB, branch number etc. where a singular mistake can lose you money. With Split, the user just has to create an account with their banking details, or PayPal account and their basic information. After that, they’ll be ready to use the app. All users have to do to transfer money; is to enter the amount they want, hold a virtual button and then “tap on” phone to phone. 
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
Sure, transferring money’s relatively easy, however transferring methods such as bank transfer takes way too long when it comes to transferring money across different branches, for example moving money from Bank of Melbourne to ANZ can take 3-7 business days. The users also have to fill in details (such as BSB, account number, branch number etc.) of the person who they’re transferring to, which is another hassle – making a simple mistake can cost you all that money that you were trying to transfer, which is also the same problem with moving money across in PayPal.
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
In detail, Split serves as a digital money transfer application. When first time launching the application, the user has to create a secured account. They sign up with their basic information such as name, address, phone number etc. as well as their credit card/debit card information such as their card number and security code. The users also have the option to use PayPal instead which is quicker and safer. After signing up, the users can log in – in which they’ll be greeted by a feature where the user can “add” their Facebook friends on their Split friends list. If they don’t have a Facebook account, the phone number will be used as a way to add people to Split’s own friends list. 
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
The friends list function allows the users to transfer money with ease. They can just go to their friends list - tap on their name, enter an amount you want to transfer, confirm the transaction and it’s done! The users also have the ability to choose where the money goes, either into their PayPal account or straight into their bank account.
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
Now the main reason as to why Split is unique in comparison to the other money transferring apps, is that users can “tap” with their friends to transfer money. What this means is that the users can bump their iPhones with their friend(s) (Bluetooth or airdrop has to be on in order to work) in order to transfer money easily. This resolve’s in having to manually transfer money over to your friend during an outing such as eating out in dinner. This makes splitting money a lot more convenient and less awkward. The instructions on doing so are relatively straight forward and simple. The user opens the application and the first page shown to them will have an integer box where the user can enter an amount of money to transfer/split. After entering an amount, they are greeted with a confirmation screen. If the user agrees, the app will showcase a small cancel button and a “Split” button. The user has to hold the split button and then bump their phone with the other user – who is in receiving mode (they have to hold a digital button as well). After bumping, the money will process and transfer with ease. 
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
Split can be used in a plethora of ways, for example splitting money after a dinner a large group in order to save the hassle of paying individually at the cashier – wasting your time and the cashier’s time too! Users can split money on the spot via tapping with friends or transferring money by using the friends list function. The possibilities are endless when it comes to transferring with Split!
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
In order to create split I would have to use PayPal’s API/developing kit, same with banking. I’d also need to take into massive consideration the security of the application, making sure I have the best software to stop user’s information from being exploited (number 1 priority!). 
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
As for the software programming, the language I would use is Swift since it’s tailored towards the iOS device – which means that I’ll be using XCode to create the application. The hardware that I’ll be creating the application with would have to be a MacBook or an apple computer since – again, the program is tailored to apple devices.
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
As for the skill, I would have to learn how to use XCode, and learn the Swift language in order to create the best UI for the user. I would also need to research the best security when it comes to the user’s important information. Another important skill to have in creating this app is the implementation of PayPal and bank accounts into the Split – as to which I’m completely clueless with as of now. 
Programming the application and implementing the payment methods will be hard to do, however there are a lot of resources online!
</p>
<p style="width: 1200px; margin-left: 350px;">
If Split is successful, people won’t have to have the tedious and inconvenience of transferring money through bank transfer or manually entering details every time. It also saves time transferring between different branches such as ANZ to Bank of Melbourne – which can take up to 7 business days to transfer. Split also allows users to transfer money on the go, by tapping on which saves the inconvenience of having to pay separately at the counter. Split just makes money transferring easy and satisfying (when tapping with a friend or friends).

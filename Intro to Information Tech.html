				<h2><u>Interest in I.T.</u></h2>
			</header>
				<p>My interest in I.T. started when I got employed by <i>Ericsson Telecommunications</i>, where I worked as an administrator 				for their newly-rolled out HR System. My team was in charge of second-line support, where we functioned both as a help-desk 					and a system process analyst that would troubleshoot and escalate the problems encountered by users in the new HR tool to 					the higher management. I got fascinated by how the system worked, and how menial tasks could be simplified using technology.
				<p>I chose to go to <b>RMIT</b> because I was more interested in the practical aspect of I.T., and the main feedback on 				channels such as Reddit was that RMIT focused more on exactly that instead of theory. As I had been out of university and 					already	working for the past eight years, I found out that in the real world, it is the practical / application side of 					things that actually matter. The university was also recommended to me by a number of friends who are alumni of this 						institution.</p>
				<p>While completing this degree, I expect to learn the ropes of programming and learn to develop software. I would also like 				to learn how to set up systems and databases that would surely be helpful once I graduate. Another thing I expect or would 					like to learn is how to manage my own website, which will be helpful in promoting my fiction books.</p>

				<h3><i>Description</i></h3>
			</header>
				<p><b>Amazon</b> is looking for an infrastructure consultant who is well-versed in SAP. The position is for creating 						solutions for the company using SAP, in the best and most efficient way to cater to best practices employed by the 						organization. It will also cover automation of some processes as well as the creation of new tools to simplify operations. 					This position appeals so much to me as I have encountered the use of SAP in my former employers - Ericsson and Citibank, and 				I would like to see how the system works from the other side, instead of the customer side.</p>
			<header class="sectionHeading">
				<h3><i>Skills, qualifications, and experience required:</i></h3>
			</header>
				<p>The position of course requires a deep understanding of SAP Systems, such as Business Objects, Mobility, and Business 					Suite, as well as administration of Basis and Netweaver. It also requires that the applicant has a bachelor level degree in 					computer science or math background, with a stated preference for a master's degree. Aside from the above, the listing puts 					a strong emphasis on a wide experience in SAP, as well as the need for communication skills and willingness to travel.</p>
				<p>At the moment, I only have a low level of experience in SAP, which is nowhere near sufficient for this as I only 						experienced SAP from the customer's side. I also still do not have a computer science degree, but I am working on that. 					Hopefully I'll be able to secure that degree by 2020.</p>
				<p>To be able to have the required skill level and experience needed to apply for this position, I of course plan to finish 					my degree first and foremost. After graduation, I am going to look for opportunities that will help me have a deeper 						understanding and ample exposure to SAP. Also, when chances arise and I get to find trainings in SAP both online and in 					classroom trainings, I would take them so I could understand it better.</p>

You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</li>

				<h2><u>Project Idea</u></h2>
			</header>
				<p>One project I have in mind is developing software that will help authors like me with writing, outlining, and laying out our books for print and e-book format. This will be a lot like the currently available platform named Vellum, but hopefully cheaper and easier to use. The software will have features that will be of use to authors who want to do their own formatting, as currently the costs of layout and book editing are quite high. I also hope to have something that will help the target market with their need to interact with beta readers and write without distractions. In this project, there will also be a feature where the author will be able to directly upload it on e-book retailers such as Amazon.</p>
				<p>Currently, there is a huge market of readers both locally and internationally, who are shifting from physical books to retailers. As a result, the line between traditional publishing and self-publishing for authors are continuously getting blurred. This project aims to help new authors such as myself to reach their market without having to shell out huge amounts of money, which authors could instead invest in marketing. The presently available software, Vellum, is quite expensive. Sure, in Australia, it is rather affordable, but back in the Philippines - the place I call my home, the average salary is much lower, therefore making the price of the software more prohibitive for those who are still starting out.</p>
				<p>The project will give the author access to a number of features, the main one being the ability to lay out their book in print or e-book format, depending on their needs. In the interface, the customer can change their book's metadata, edit the appearance, add decorations or clip-art stuff pasted on the page for the readers to distinguish between chapters or sections. The customer will also be able to decide on the overall look of their book. For beginners, it will have a wizard to guide them through the works and the basics. Outlining and plotting services / features will also be built in, to help authors with the writing aspect of things. Handy tools such as word count both at the chapter and book level will be available for the author's monitoring. In this software, I hope to incorporate a feature where more than one user will be able to access. Authors usually have beta readers who provide a fresh take or perspective on the manuscript. Using the software, I want to have a feature for beta readers where they will be able to comment on the book's current look.</p>
				<p>As the customers get used to the software, there will be features available for them to customize their book's look, and saved templates will also be a possibility, so that authors will be able to put their own unique touch on all of their books and future releases, similar to how the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson books are all formatted in the same way. Ornamental features will also be at the customer's disposal, and they will be able to input images, and subheads for the book. Trim sizes and format options will be available as well once the layout is finished, and users will be able to preview what their book will look like once printed on paper or on Kindle, as well as other book platforms or channels such as Smashwords and Gumroad. The software, in addition, will have features to pick up stuff such as page breaks and headings to help it break the text apart in chapters automatically. I also plan to incorporate in the project a way for the author to format book series or boxed sets, which usually help in promotions. 
This project, unlike the currently available software in the market, will be made available for both Mac and PC users, making it accessible to all kinds of authors who wish to do their own book layouts. There will also be options for the user to add color in the books if they wish. The book cover will also be checked by the software if the size or resolution is just right for the selected measurements.</p>
				
				<p>The software, once rolled out, will be available for purchase on a website for PC users, then on the App store for Mac users. Software needed will be similar to features of the basic word processor. As for hardware needs, the project will simply have to be on a PC or a Mac, nothing too fancy. As for codes and features, I'm still going to learn this along the way, hopefully. No other equipment will be needed.</p>

				<p>As there are no special hardware needed for this project, the only skills that will be needed are for coding. Some special programming know-how will have to be employed to be able to design a word processor with so many add-ons. There will also be a need to reach out to Amazon and other e-book reading platforms so as to have access to uploading manuscripts from the software to their database. While this skill level and permissions required may take some time to be acquired, this project, in my opinion, is very much feasible as long as the developer or team handling it is committed.</p>
				<p>For the outcome, I expect the software to be successful with the target market, as it incorporates everything that every starting author needs, from outlining, to writing, and to finally publishing their work out in the international market. I expect the outcome to have more authors having access to channels they didn't think was possible. With the roll-out of this software, I hope to empower authors, especially from third world countries such as mine. This way the authors will not have to depend on traditional publishers to get their books out. Hopefully, with the use of my project, authors such as myself could reach new boundaries and readership bases. With affordable software that caters to their writing and publishing needs, the original problem of having prohibitive prices to publishing software and high publishing costs will be addressed. </p>

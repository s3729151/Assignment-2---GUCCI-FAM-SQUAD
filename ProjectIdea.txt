         What the project will be is a helpful reminder system to people who have busy lives and still want a pet, specifically fish.
         <p> The kind of IT innovation that I would like to see is a fish tank monitor that sends alerts to a selected device when the water temperature is not in a specific range, ph levels aren’t correct, water level is too low as well as alerting feeding times and other care requirements. This will provide an effective system to ensure that the fish that require a high amount of attention when being first housed in a new tank, have the best chance of survival. </p>
         <p> Why this project will be useful is because many people think that fish are just an easy to look after pet, however there is a lot more then just putting your fish in water and feeding once or twice a day. Especially tropical fish such as Siamese fighting fish otherwise known as the beta fish, require a heated tank that is well filtered and have specific ph levels that the water needs to be, for the fish to survive as well as thrive. A lot of care is required into keeping a fish, peoples mentality that “it’s just a fish” should be no more, because they are just as important as a pet like a dog. During the first 6 weeks of the fish in a new environment is when it is at its most vulnerable and a routine needs to be established so that the tank can be filtered and cleaned, while maintaining a perfect water quality. Any changes can result in the fish stressing and in most cases, death. </p>
         <p> This product will have many features to ensure that the fish or the multiple fish in the tank are best cared for. Normally advised from the store/business that the fish were purchased from, specific temperature boundaries and pH levels need to be entered into the system. These are vital for the aquarium environment as sudden changes in these factors can shock the fish and even cause death. As the Ph levels rise the toxicity of chemicals like ammonia rise. If ammonia, nitrate, chlorine and nitrite levels are not within range this can cause the fish to be stressed and negatively affect respiration abilities. These chemical levels are monitored with a pH sensor. Temperature ranges are also important as fish are required to be kept ideal temperature ranges for the fish to the best health. This is monitored with Temperature Sensor. Another factor that is important to the environment of the Aquarium is the waters electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity is important because it helps provide information on the tanks environment. It is something that can be equivalated to a humans body temperature, changes in body temperature can mean something is changing or illness, and needs to monitored and investigated. This is monitored with a conductivity sensor. Furthermore depending on your tank size, a filter or water pump is needed to ensure dirt and grime is removed from the tanks water, benefiting the respiration of the fish, creating a cleaner environment. 
            These four automated functions benefit the tank environment, however more technology can be implemented so that not only the factors are monitored but the owner of the tank is monitored when changes occur and receive daily reports of the tank.
            There are more automated functions that can help benefit the fish specifically. These include automated feeding times, automated medicine dispensing, automated day/night cycles using LED lamps, water levels and leak detection. All of the processes are normally undertaken by the owners, by implementing Arduino Technology, in combination with dispensers and sensors, these tasks can be automated. 
            By using the Arduino Technology the system will send messages to a specific devices alerting them of any changes in the environment, for instance if the temperature becomes too hot, the owner will be notified so the heater can be fixed. By alerting the owners of complications with the machinery the owner can repair faults as soon as possible, increasing the longevity of the fish.

         <p> Ardiuno is an open source electronics platform based on beginner level software and hardware. Ardiuno consists of a free source code editor in combination of a simple hardware platform with a with a “one-click compile/upload”. It is created to be easy to use without being a knowledgeable programmer. A way to start writing programs is using Arduino IDE. It is a simple code editor with syntax with a number of buttons for compiling and uploading. The program is created in the IDE, then you plug the Arduino board using the provided cable, click the "Upload" button and your program is compiled and sent across to the board where it is saved in non-volatile memory.

         <p> The skills that are required for the project is a beginner level coding and a beginner level knowledge of circuits and electrical components. These skills can be learnt and obtained through online tutorials or physical workshops. Hardware required would consist of a Arduino Kit. These can be purchased through online stores such as ebay. Other specialised components that aren’t included in the kit will be required to be pruchsed online. These can be bought at specialised online stores and ebay. </p>

         <p>If this project is successful this can differ the world is by providing a more efficient way of running a fish tank, prolonging the fishes life. The problem of the owners forgetting to care for there pet specially their fish, will be solved through programmed dispensers and sensors to notify people. The impact of this development will be an effective system to ensure that the fish that require a high amount of attention when being first housed in a new tank, have the best chance of survival.

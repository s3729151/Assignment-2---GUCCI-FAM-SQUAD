<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      </center>
      <p>What is your interest in IT?</P>
      <ul>
         <li> My interest in IT is specifically the algorithms behind social media platforms. They are self-learning algorithms that adapt to peoples needs and wants. I am interested on peoples need for technology and how it can be adapted into everyday lives. Apart of most people’s lives today is social media, it connects friends, families and strangers around the world and the industry is only booming. Technology is now, in your pocket, on your wrist, in your car, it is your car and in your home. The dependency and convince of technology is also something I find interesting, as it is something that can be harnessed to create valid and ever-expanding business ideas. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </p>
      <ul>
         <li>I have always been interested in IT but I was never going to pursue it because I saw it as a hobby. However, in year 11 I last minute decided to swap out of the subject Visual Communications Design 1/2 as I decided I was more interested in why people are engaged in media, so I picked up Media Studies 1/2. As a result of this I had to fill the gap where VCD was and chose to do Computer Studies 1/2 because I always had an interest in IT. Through this I continued both Media and IT in my 3/4’s, choosing to do Software Development. Due to this last minute change in VCE subjects I have now found my passion for understanding the mechanics behind Social Media platforms and the people who use them. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
      <ul>
         <li>My IT experience is minimal although there is some there. During high school I was apart of the Digital Technology Group, were we set up the Audio and Visual sides for assemblies and public school events, such as tours and presentations to parents. Also assisted with class room technology issues. In 2017 I was the first ever appointed Digital Technology Leader at Plenty Campus as well as the first ever female digital leader cross campus. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
      <ul>
         <li>I chose to come to RMIT because of the hands-on learning aspect in the courses. This is what sets it apart from other universities. The practical approach acts as work experience for students so that they are industry ready by the time the successfully complete their course. I also chose RMIT because it is a well-known technology university that will add value to my resumé. Another reason why I chose RMIT is because I wanted a change of scenery and the city life seemed like something I would enjoy. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
      <ul>
         <li>During my studies at RMIT I expect to learn skills that will help me in whatever industry I would like to enter, whether it be working at an IT helpdesk or running my own multi billion-dollar company. I would also expect to learn during my studies the knowledge of the industry and how to apply it. It would be worthless if we did all this practical work and not being able to provide knowledge of the industry and convey it to other people. Personable skills are required thrive in any workplace. </li>
      </ul>

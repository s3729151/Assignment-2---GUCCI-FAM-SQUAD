								<h3>My Interest</h3>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
								<p>My interest in the IT field was started when I was doing my year 10. This developed to a great high when Mr.Sundar Pichai became he CEO of Google in 2015. His story inspired me and that made me to choose IT as my carrier.</p>

								<h4>Dream University</h4>
								<p>My main objective of this scavenge is to find a dream university in which I could get experimental and realistic command of an IT company. I started exploring for universities which amplify my knowledge in the field of information technology and to get hands on practice experience. I found that RMIT is one of the top universities where I should pursue my studies to reach my dream career. The special reason for me to select RMIT is because it is ranked among the top 100 universities in the field of computer science and information systems and 14th best university in Australia. I found that RMIT University is the premier university to fulfil my dream.</p>
